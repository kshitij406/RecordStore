          <h1>Records that stay with you after the last note.</h1>

          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Seraphim Records</strong>, a record store for people who like to
            slow down, drop the needle and listen on purpose.
          </p>

          <p>
            The store brings together albums that feel good to own and to play. From the
            spacey pull of <em>The Dark Side of the Moon</em> to the bright confidence of
            <em>Abbey Road</em> and the washed colours of <em>Currents</em>, every title is
            chosen because it leaves something behind after the music stops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sometimes that is a line like <em>all you touch and all you see</em>, sometimes
            it is the quiet feeling you get when the last track fades. Either way, our aim
            is simple: help you leave with music that actually fits your taste and your space.

          <h2>Built around albums that mean something.</h2>
          <p>
            The catalogue behind Seraphim Records leans on albums that still get talked
            about long after release. Records like <em>Grace</em>, <em>Yeezus</em>,
            <em>Abbey Road</em> and <em>Currents</em> are not just popular, they are
            reference points. They are the records people play when they want to feel
            something specific.
          </p>
          <p>
            We treat every new addition through that lens. Does it hold up next to the
            giants, or at least stand confidently in its own lane? If the answer is yes,
            it earns a spot in the collection.
